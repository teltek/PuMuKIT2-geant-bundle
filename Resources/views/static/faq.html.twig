	<h2>FAQ's</h2>

	<strong>Q: What kind of content shall I find at the edu<font
		color="#e81657">OER</font> front-end Portal?
	</strong>
	<p>
		<strong>A:</strong> The edu<font color="#e81657">OER</font> front-end
		portal gives access to multimedia content (video lectures, webinars,
		conferences, multimedia text etc.), coming from various educational
		institutions, national research and education networks (NRENs).
	</p>
	<br> <strong>Q: Why edu<font color="#e81657">OER</font>?
	</strong>
	<p>
		<strong>A:</strong>NRENS advocate that simply providing open access to
		education systems is not sufficient. Instead, the FAIR (findable,
		accessible, interoperable, re-usable) principle of content (the Data
		FAIRport initiative) is the appropriate way to address Open Education.
		That way, "federated access" to "openly licensed" educational content,
		in a as rich as possible "searchable" way, is the key to ensure the
		full benefits of Open Education.
	</p>
	<br> <strong>Q: Who is behind this effort?</strong>
	<p>
		<strong>A:</strong>The edu<font color="#e81657">OER</font> portal is
		supported by <a href="http://www.geant.org/About/Pages/Home.aspx"
			target="_blank">GEANT</a>, the leading collaboration on
		e-infrastructure and services for research and education, and has been
		created via the collaboration and share of knowledge between several
		National Research and Education Networks. You may find more details
		about the participating organizations <a
			href="https://oer.geant.org/partners/" target="_blank">here</a>.
	</p>
	<br> <strong>Q: We represent a higher education multimedia content
		repository. How can we share/ expose our content through the edu<font
		color="#e81657">OER</font> Front-End Portal?
	</strong>
	<p>
		<strong>A:</strong>Educational repositories and relevant content
		providers are invited to expose and share metadata (i.e the
		information about the content) of their open educational resources via
		the edu<font color="#e81657">OER</font> Hub. The edu<font
			color="#e81657">OER</font> Hub is the back-end engine behind the OER
		Web Portal. It also provides value-added services to the connected
		repositories in order to discover, analyze, validate and enrich their
		metadata. You will find guidelines for participating <a
			href="https://oer.geant.org/participate/" target="_blank">here</a>.
		Please also, find out which are the mandatory metadata elements <a
			href="https://services.oer.geant.org/site/ap/mandatory/"
			target="_blank">here</a>.
	</p>
	<br> <strong>Q: What kind of services do you provide to content
		providers?</strong>
	<p>
		<strong>A:</strong>The edu<font color="#e81657">OER</font> service
		provides a large number of services to content providers such as
		metadata analytics, validation, mapping and transformation against
		selected application profiles, monitoring via dashboards etc. You can
		find details <a
			href="https://oer.geant.org/services-for-content-providers/"
			target="_blank">here</a>.
	</p>

	<br> <strong>Q: Why OER by NRENS?</strong>
	<p>
		<strong>A:</strong>Many of the European NRENS are active in open
		education activities and have made a significant contribution to the
		deployment and availability of oe digital technology and content.
		Apart from that, NRENS are in a privileged position to produce/provide
		infrastructure and develop/support new technologies, (e.g. search
		technologies, metadata harmonization, federated access, portal
		creation). Additionally, NRENS are in a good position to spread the
		word about new methods of teaching/learning to academic/research
		institutions..
	</p>

	<br> <strong>Q: How large will the time investment be for a content
		provider in order to push their metadata to the eduOER service?</strong>
	<p>
		<strong>A:</strong>The main factors on this are:
	
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Technological compliance:</strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Metadata exposure through <a
					href="https://services.oer.geant.org/site/oai/" target="_blank">OAI-PMH
						protocol</a>.
				</li>
				<li>Metadata exposure through RSS.</li>
			</ul></li>

		<li><strong>Content compliance.</strong><a
